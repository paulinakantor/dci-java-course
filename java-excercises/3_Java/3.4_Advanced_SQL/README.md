## Overview
This submodule provides learners with advanced SQL techniques.

## Objectives
By the end of this submodule, the learners should be able to:

* Understand and know how to combine multiple tables together using JOIN statements
* Know more advanced datatypes and use them
* Understand and create sub queries in SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE statements
* Know different aggregate functions and use them in queries
* Know how to group and filter records using GROUP BY and HAVING statements

### Exercises - instruction
The following section describes standalone exercises to give to students. 
For excercises you need to use Northwind database.
You can follow given instruction to set up this database: https://github.com/pthom/northwind_psql

Solution: 


Sub queries excercises
Time: 1TU ~ 45min
When: After lecture about sub queries (but max() function should be explained first)

Aggregate functions excercises
Time: 1TU ~ 45min
When: After lecture about aggregate functions (without group by & having)

GROUP BY & HAVING excercises
Time: 3TU ~ 2h15min
When: After all lectures (includes examples with aggregate functions, joins, sub queries). Also, knowledge about ordering (ORDER BY), limiting the result(LIMIT) and aliasing(AS) is important here.
